## Description

The boilerplate for next projects and commit-story of how Ruslan is tried to launch k8s cluster on local machine with Apple M1 Pro (arm64) with broken ingress-nginx-controller and one day minikube just started working fine on default settings. :((  
Of course if you are not forgot to add `127.0.0.1 domain.com` to `/etc/hosts`
